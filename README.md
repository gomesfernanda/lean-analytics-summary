This is the beginning of my trajectory to become an *_awesome_* data scientist.

![yeah](https://78.media.tumblr.com/1469dd06f88dd0e57bf8b128019f3bac/tumblr_owcy6b44HT1w5ioxwo6_400.gif)

I have no degree on computer science and I'm not a "formal" software engineer.
I have however a bachelor degree in Physics, so my math background is pretty solid.

I already know Python (thanks to [MIT course on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python)) but I have A LOT to improve, and I plan to learn Go too.

This is what I figured so far for my development:

### PGA Study
