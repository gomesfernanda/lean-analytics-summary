## Data Science from Scratch

I am following the book written by Joel Grus and published by O'Reilly; you can find it [here](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do).

I will not write all the code on the book here, I'll write mainly the code that I struggle with and/or that will be used throughout the following chapters.

The book's author has [a repo](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) with the most important pieces of code in the book (for Python 2.7 and 3).

Further on I plan on turning the Python scripts into Jupyter notebooks, since I believe they are visually more interesting and easy to understand.
