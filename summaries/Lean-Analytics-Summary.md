## PART 1: Stop lying to yourself

### Chapter 1 - We're all liars
- Sometimes, growth comes from an aspect of your business you don't expect. When you think you've found a worthwhile idea, decide how to test it quickly, with minimal investment. Define what success looks like beforehand, and know what you're going to do if your hunch is right.
Lean, analytical thinking is about asking the right questions, and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you're after.

### Chapter 2 - How to Keep Score
- What makes a good metric?
    - a good metric is comparative.
    - a good metric is understandable.
    - a good metric is a ratio or a rate (ratio is easier to act on, are inherently comparative and also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there's an inherent tension).
    - a good metric changes the way you behave.
- Accounting metrics: like sales revenue and such, shows how close you are to your business model.
- Experimental metrics: like the results of a test , help you optimize the product/pricing/market. Change in these metrics will change your behavior.
- If you want to change behavior, your metric must be tied to the behavioral change you want. If you measure something and it's not attached to a goal, you're wasting your time.
- Metrics often come in pairs.
- KPIs (key performance indicators): specific metrics that drive the business.
- Qualitative vs Quantitative Metrics
    - To get a business started, you need qualitative input because you're exploring.
    - Quantitative data abhors emotion; qualitative data marinates in it.
    - Collecting good qualitative data takes preparation so you don't get misleading results.
- Vanity Vs Real Metrics
    - If you have a piece of data that you can't act on, it's vanity metric.
    - Key question: "what will I do differently based on this information?"
    - Vanity metrics: number of hits, page views, visits, unique visitors, followers/friends/likes, time on site/number of pages, emails collected, downloads.
- Exploratory Vs Reporting Metrics
    - Reporting: the "known unknowns"; we know we don't know the value of the metric, so we go find out.
    - Exploratory: the "unknown unknowns"; leads to discoveries that can disrupt the market.
- Leading Vs Lagging Metrics
    - Leading: tries to predict the future.
    - Lagging: gives you an indication that there's a problem.
    - For leading indicators to work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.
    - Lagging and leading metrics can both be actionable, but leading indicators show you what _will_ happen, reducing your cycle time and making you leaner.
- Correlated Vs Causal Metrics
    - Correlations can help you predict what will happen, but finding the _cause_ of something means you can change it.
    - You prove causality by finding a correlation, then running an experiment in which you control the other variables and measure the difference (however, this is a very hard thing to do in practice).
    - Correlation is good. Causality is great.
- Moving targets:
    - At the beginning of your business, your metrics and goals will be a little blurred, and this shall be adjusted as time passes and you have a clearer idea of the ones that are more meaningful.
    - It's reasonable to update your metrics accordingly.
    - Make early assumptions and set targets for what you think success looks like, but don't experiment yourself into oblivion. Lower the bar if necessary, but not for the sake of getting over it.
    - Use qualitative data to understand what value you're creating and adjust only if the new 'line in the sand' reflects how customers are using your product.
- Testing creates a kind of scientific comparison that may be useful to justify a change
- Segmentation
    - Segment: a group that shares some common characteristic.
- Cohort analysis
    - Compares similar groups over time.
    - One compares cohorts against one another to see if, on the whole, key metrics are getting better over time.
- A/B and Multivariate testing
    - Cross-sectional studies: studies in which different groups of test subjects are given different experiences at the same time.
    - Problem with A/B testing: you'll have more things to test than you'll have traffic.

    - Multivariate analysis: analyze a series of tests done at the same time, relying on statistical analysis of the results to see which of many factors correlates strongly with an improvement in traffic.
- Much of Lean Analytics is about finding a meaningful metric, then running experiments to improve it until that metric is good enough for you to move to the next problem or next stage of your business.

### Chapter 3 - Deciding What to Do With Your Life
- Lean Canvas: nine boxes organized on a sheet of paper, designed to walk through the most important aspects of business.
    - Problem (& existing alternatives)
    - Solution
    - Key metrics
    - Unique value proposition (& high-level concept)
    - Unfair advantage
    - Channels
    - Customer segments (& early adopters)
    - Cost Structure
    - Revenue streams
- Don't start a business you’re going to hate.
- When launching a new venture, you need to properly assess:
    - If you want to do it.
    - If you're good doing it.
    - If you can make money doing it.
- If you want to do something and are good at it, but can’t be paid to do it, _learn to monetize_.
- If you’re good at something and can be paid to do it, but don’t like doing it, _learn to say no_.
- If you like to do something and can be paid to do it, but aren’t very good at it, _learn to do it well_.
- Never start a company on a level playing field— that’s where everyone else is standing.

### Chapter 4 - Data-Driven Versus Data-Informed
- Data-driven machine optimization, when not moderated by human judgment, can cause problems.
    - Humans do inspiration, machines do validation.
    - Optimization is all about finding the lowest or highest values of a particular function. A machine can find an optimal setting, but it will be a *local* optimal.
    - Humans, on the other hand, can find other "functions".
    - Math is good at optimizing a known system; humans are good at finding a new one.
- Machine-only optimization suffers from limitations. If you're optimizing for local maxima, you might be missing a bigger, more important opportunity.
- Companies can get *too* data-driven. Instead, they could be more data-informed.
- How to think like a data scientist: avoid common pitfalls like...
    - Assuming the data is clean.
    - Not normalizing.
    - Excluding outliers.
    - Including outliers.
    - Ignoring seasonality.
    - Ignoring size when reporting growth.
    - Data vomit.
    - Metrics that cry wolf.
    - The "Not Collected Here" syndrome.
    - Focusing on noise.
- Entrepreneurs should find the perfect combination of big vision and data.
- You need to think of Lean Startup as the process you use to move toward and achieve your vision.

## PART 2 - Finding the right metric for right now

### Chapter 5 - Analytics Frameworks
- There are a set of frameworks, and each one offers a different perspective on a startup life cycle.
- Some frameworks are:
- **Dave McClure's Pirate Metrics**
    - metrics that a startup needs fit into the categories: AARRA = acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, and referral.
    - acquisition: how do users become aware of you? traffic, mentions, CPC, search results, cost acquisition, open rate.
    - activation: do drive-by visitors subscribe and use? enrollments, signups, completed on boarding process, used the service at least once, subscriptions.
    - retention: does a one-time user become engaged? engagement, time since last visit, daily and monthly active use, churn.
    - revenue: do you make money from user activity? customer lifetime value, conversion rate, shopping cart size, click-through revenue.
    - referral: do users promote your product? invites sent, viral coefficient, viral cycle time.
- **Eric Ries's Engines of Growth**
    - 3 engines that drive the growth of a startup, each one with KPIs.
    - 1. Sticky Engine: focus of getting users to return. Engagement is key here. Fundamental KPI is user retention.
    - 2. Virality Engine: is all about getting the word out. Key metric is _viral coefficient_ |(number of new users that bring new ones on).
    - 3. Paid Engine: payment. Important KPIs: customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC).
- **Ash Maurya's Lean Canvas**
    - Box: "Problem" // Metrics: respondents who have this need, respondents who are aware of having the need.
    - Box: "Solution" // Metrics: respondents who try the MVP, engagement, churn, most/last used features, people willing to pay.
    - Box: "Unique value proposition" // Metrics: feedback scores, independent ratings, sentiment analysis, customer-worded descriptions, surveys, search, competitive analysis.
    - Box: "Customer segments" // Metrics: how easy it is to find groups of prospects, unique key-work segments, targeted funnel traffic from a particular source.
    - Box: "Channels" // Metrics: leads and customers per channel, viral coefficient and cycle, net promoter score, open rate, affiliate margins, click-through rate, PageRank, message search.
    - Box: "Unfair advantage" // Metrics: respondents' understanding of the UVP (unique value proposition), patents, brand equity, barriers to entry, number of new entrants, exclusivity of relationships.
    - Box: "Revenue streams" // Metrics: lifetime customer value, average revenue per user, conversion rate, shopping cart size, click-through rate.
    - Box: "Cost structure" // Metrics: fixed costs, cost of customer acquisition, cost of servicing the nth customer, support costs, keyword costs.
- **Sean Elli's Startup Growth Pyramid**
    - ![SeanElli](http://i64.tinypic.com/2ho90zo.png)
    - This pyramid is focused on _after_ you achieve market fit.
    - How to know you've achieved market fit: survey with customer asking how they would feel if they could no longer use the product/service. If 40% or more say they'd be disappointed, you're market fit and it's time to scale.
- **The Long Funnel**
    - A way of understanding how you first come to someone's attention, and the journey she takes from that initial awareness through a goal you want her to complete.
- Lean Analytics Stages and Gates:
    - 5 stages: Empathy, Stickiness, Virality, Revenue, and Scale.

### Chapter 6 - The Discipline of One Metric That Matters
- One of the keys to startup success is _focus_.
- "One Metric That Matters" (OMTM): a single metric that's incredibly important for the step you're currently working through.
- OMTM is the number you're completely focused on above everything else.
- Besides the OMTM, you'll track the KPIs. And other metrics will be stored for future use.
- "Too much" data can be counterproductive: you can get lost in strange trends on numbers that are not big picture, and also lose time reporting metrics that don't lead to action.
- Pick a minimal set of KPIs on which your business assumptions rely.
- 4 reasons to use OMTM:
    - It answers the most important question you have.
    - It forces you to draw a line in the sand and have clear goals.
    - It focuses the entire company.
    - It inspires a culture of experimentation.
- Besides knowing the metric you should focus on, you need to draw a line in the sand: pick a number, set it as a target, and have enough confidence that if you hit it, you consider it a success.
- Optimizing your OMTM squeezes your metrics getting the most out of it, but also reveals the next place you need to focus your efforts.
- Whatever your current OMTM, expect it to change. And expect that change to reveal the next piece of data you need to build a better business faster.

### Chapter 7 - What business are you in?
- How you get and make money drives what metrics you should care about.
- To decide which metrics you should track you need to step back, ignore all the details, and just think about the really big components.
- One common theme in all startups is that their growth is achieved by one of Eric Ries's fundamental Engines of Growth: an increase in stickiness, virality, or revenue. Each business model needs to maximize the trust from these three engines in order to flourish.
- Business growth comes from improving one of these five "knobs":
    - **More stuff** means adding more products or services;
    - **More people** means adding more users, ideally through virality or word of mouth, but also through paid advertising.
    - **More often** means stickiness (so people come back), reduced churn (so they don't leave), and repeated use (so they use it more frequently). Early on, stickiness tends to be a key knob on which to focus.
    - **More money** means upselling and maximizing the price users will pay, or the revenue from ad clicks, or the amount of content they create, or the number of in-game purchases they make.
    - **More efficiently** means reducing the cost of delivering and supporting your service, and also lowering the cost of customer acquisition.
- Business models are about getting **people** to do what you want in return for something. But not all people are equal...
    - Some are good, but on the long run. They can use your free version for a long time until pay for it.
    - Some provide free marketing: they will never sign up and be paying users.
    - Some are bad: they distract you, consume resources, etc.
- You need to segment real, valuable users from drive-by, curious ones. Then you need to make changes that maximize the real users and weed out the bad ones.
- As a startup, you have a wide range of payment and incentive models from which to choose: freemium, free trial, pay up-front, discount, etc. Your choice needs to match the kind of segmentation you're doing, the time it takes for a user to become a paying customer, how easy it is to use your service, and how costly an additional drive-by user is to the business.
- A business model is a combination of things: it's what you sell, how you deliver it, how you acquire customers, and how you make money from them.
- To build a business model you can combine several aspects of a business:
    - The **acquisition channel**: how people find out about you.
    - The **selling tactic**: how you convince visitors to become users/customers.
    - The **revenue source**: how you make money.
    - The **product type**: what value your business offers in return for the revenue.
    - The **delivery model**: how you get your product to the customer.

### Chapter 8 - Model One: E-commerce
- Early e-commerce consisted of "funnel": a visitor arrived at the page, navigated through sub-pages to reach a particular item, clicked "buy", provided payment information and completed purchase.
- Modern e-commerce is less simple than early e-commerce:
    - The majority of buyers find what they're looking for through search, instead of navigating across the pages. This means on-site funnels are outdated; keywords are more important.
    - Retailers use recommendation engine to anticipate what else a user might want.
    - Retailers are always optimizing performance, meaning that they're segmenting traffic.
    - Purchases begin far from the website itself, in social medias, e-mail, online communities and so on.
- Loyalty-focused e-retailers build a recurring relationship with their users, encouraging customers to build wishlists and review products.
- It's essential for retailers to know what kind of relationship they have with their customers, because this drives everything from marketing strategy to shopping cart size.
    - To understand this: *annual repurchase rate*, what % of people who bought from you last year will do so this year?
    - Acquisition: If less than 40% of last year's buyers will buy this year, then your focus is on new customer acquisition.
    - Hybrid: If 40-60% of last year's buyers will buy this year, then the company will grow with a mix of new and returning customers. You need to focus on acquisition as well as increasing purchase frequency.
    - Loyalty: If 60% or more of last year's buyers will buy this year, company needs to focus on loyalty, encouraging customers to buy more frequently.
- Even before a year has passed, an e-commerce can look at a 90-day repurchase rate:
    - a rate of 1% to 15% means you're in acquisition mode.
    - a rate of 15% to 30% means you're in hybrid mode.
    - a rate of +30% means you're in loyalty mode.
- While it's important to optimize revenues, don't try to make your customers into something they're not, or force seasonal customers to become loyal customers.
- Some relevant metrics to an e-commerce:
    - Conversion rate: percentage of visitors to your site that buys something. One of the first metrics you use to assess how you're doing. You'll slice conversion rate in many ways - by demographics, by copy, by referral etc - to see what makes people more likely to buy.
    - Purchases per year: if you look at the repurchase rate on a 90-day cycle, it becomes a very good leading indicator of what type of e-commerce site you have. There is no right or wrong answer.
    - Shopping cart size: not only you want to know what percentage of people bought something, you also want to know how much they spent. You may find that one campaign is more likely to make people buy, but another might make fewer people spend more money. In practice, you'll compare the total revenue you're generating to the way in which you acquired that revenue, to identify the most lucrative segments of your audience.
    - Abandonment: number of people who abandon a funnel in each stage. It's important to analyze it for each step to see which parts of the process are hurting you the most (reviewing shopping cart, providing shipping information, payment process).
    - Cost of Customer Acquisition: you may be using advertising, social media outreach, mailing lists or affiliates to drive traffic to your site. You have to add it up. By the end of the day, you have to make more from selling things than it costs you to find buyers and deliver goods.
    - Revenue Per Customer (or lifetime value): important for all types of e-commerce (acquisition, hybrid, loyalty). Even if your business doesn't engender loyalty, you want to maximize revenue by increasing shopping cart size and conversion rate while reducing abandonment.
    - Keywords and Search Terms: you want to know which keywords drive traffic that turns into money. You'll analyze outside your site (search engines) and within your site (first, you'll be sure what users are after; second, if a significant chunk of searches falls into a category, you should re-position it on your page).
    - Recommendation Acceptance Rate: there are many different approaches to recommendations. Some use what the buyer has purchased in the past, others try to predict purchases from visitors attributes.
    - Virality: referral and viral attention drive cheap, high-value traffic.
    - Mailing List Click-Through Rates: if you can the permission to reach out to your customers - and they do what you tell them to - you can keep them engaged far more effectively. You calculate the e-mail click-through rate by dividing the number of visits you get from a campaign by the number of messages you've sent.
    - Shipping Time: efficiencies like this turn into a competitive advantage, because they let you sell to consumers who are more interested in a faster service.
    - Stock Availability: improving your inventory management can make a big difference to your bottom line, since sales go down when items are out of stock. It's also interesting to analyze inventory versus sales.

### Chapter 9 - Model Two: Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Most SaaS providers generate revenue from a monthly (or yearly) subscription.
- Because the incremental cost of adding another customer to a SaaS service is negligible, many SaaS providers use a freemium model of customer acquisition.
- Key metrics that companies with freemium model and several tiers of subscription are usually aware of:
    - Attention: how effectively the business attract visitors.
    - Enrollment: how many visitors become free or trial users.
    - Stickiness: how much the customers use the product.
    - Conversion: how many of the free users become paying customers.
    - Revenue per customer.
    - Customer acquisition cost.
    - Virality: how likely customers are to invite others, and how long they take to do so.
    - Upselling: what makes customers increase their spending, and how often that happens.
    - Uptime and reliability: how many complaints, problem escalations or outages the company has.
    - Churn: how many users and customers leave.
    - Lifetime value: how much customers are worth from cradle to grave.
- Customer lifetime value (CLV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) are two essential metrics for a subscription business.

**Measuring Engagement**

- The ultimate metric for engagement is _daily use_.
- Lesson: bring an early version of your product, and look for where it's got the highest engagement among your customers. Find the subsection os users that are hooked to your product, figure out what's common to them, refocus on their needs, and grow from there.
- However, your early adopters needs might not reflect those of the bigger, more lucrative mainstream.
- Besides looking at visit frequency, look for _usage patterns_ inside your application. What are people doing inside your application?

**Churn**

- In a freemium or free-trial business, you should track churn for both users (non-paid) and customers (paid) groups separately.
- Unpaid users "churn" by cancelling their accounts or not coming back; paid users churn by cancelling their accounts (stopping paying) or reverting to an unpaid version.
- Formula for churn: (# of churns during period) / (# customers at beginning of period)
- However, this formula is too simple, since your take a churn that happens in a certain period of time and divide by a snapshot, fixed number of customers.
- Solution: new formula for the churn.
- Churn = (number of churns during period)/[(# customers at beginning of period) + (# customers at end of period)]/2
- However, if you're growing really fast, this solution is also not ideal.
- Two ways to simplify: 1) measure churn _by cohort_, so you're comparing new to churned users based on when they first became users and 2) measure churn each day.
- In a SaaS model, most of the complexity comes from 2 things: the promotional approach you choose, and pricing tiers.
- While freemium gets a lot of visibility, it's actually a _sales tactic_, and you need to use it carefully.

### Chapter 10 - Model Three: Free Mobile App

- Unlike web applications, where it's easy to do A/B testing and continuous deployment, mobile apps go through the app store gatekeeper.
- Mobile app developers make money within their applications in several ways:
    - Downloadable content (such as maps or vehicles).
    - Flair and customization of in-character appearance and gaming content.
    - Advantages.
    - Elimination of countdown timers.
    - Upselling to a paid version.
    - In-game ads.
- A company like this cares about the following metrics:
    - Downloads
    - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
    - Launch rate (% of people who download, actually launch, and create an account at the app)
    - Percent of active users/players (daily active users - DAU - or monthly active users - MAU)
    - Percentage of users who pay
    - Time to first purchase
    - Monthly average revenue per user (ARPU)
    - Ratings click-through
    - Virality
    - Churn
    - Customer lifetime value

**Instalation Volume**

- For mobile developers, the dynamics of an app store matter more than almost anything else when it comes to traction.
- An app thats already in the top 100 and then gets featured will jump an average of **42** places on the Android market, **27** places on the iPad App Store and **15** places on the iPhone App Store.
- If you want to make money, you need to be ranked highly in app stores, and getting featured helps a great deal.
- If you're making a game, you walk a fine line between the compelling content and addictive gameplay that makes things fun and the in-game purchases that bring you money.
- Besides ARPU, some metrics relate to **playability** and player engagement are important.

**Percentage of users who pay**

- Knowing the difference between users that won't spend money on your game, and users who will spend thousands of dollars, and finding ways to make more users make in-app purchases, is the key to a successfully monetized free mobile application.
- Beyond the basic metric of "percentage of users that pay something", you want to do segmentation and cohort analysis.

**Churn**

- Track churn at 1 day, 1 week and 1 month, because users leave ar different times for different reasons. Knowing when users churn gives you an indication of why they're churning and what you can try in order to keep them longer.

### Chapter 11 - Model Four: Media Site

- If your business model most closely resembles a media site, then your primary focus is sharing advertisers' messages with viewers, and getting paid for impressions, click-throughs, or sales.
- Ad revenue sometimes is tied to the number of clicks on ads; sometimes it's simply a display advertising shown each time there's an engagement with a visitor.
- Media sites care most of all about *click-through* or *display rates*, since those are actual revenue, but they also need to maximize visitor's time on the website, number of pages visited and number of unique visitors, since those things represent inventory.
- Striking a balance between commercial screen space and valuable content is tricky but important, since too much space displaying ads undermines the site's quality and keep visitors from coming back.
- 4 revenue models common to media sites: sponsorship, display advertising, click-based advertising and affiliate.
- Ultimately, media sites care about:

1) Audience and churn
- The more people who visit your site, the more money you'll make.
- Engagement is much more important that traffic, so knowing how many visitors you're losing is critical.

2) Ad inventory
- Number of impressions that can be monetized.
- The total number of unique page views in a given period of time, since each page view is a chance to show a visitor an ad.
- The actual inventory depends on page layout and how many advertising elements are on each page.

3) Ad rates
- How much a site can make from those impressions based on the content it covers and people who visit.
- The rate advertising networks will pay yu for an ad depends on your content and the going rate for a particular search ter or keyword.

4) Click-through rates
- How many of the impressions actually turn into money.

5) Content/advertising balance
- Decisions to be made by media site companies:
    - Ad space: too many ads leads to lousy content and reduced visitor loyalty.
    - Content: if your content is written to attract lucrative ad words, it'll feel forced and seem like a paid promotion.

### Chapter 12 - Model Five: User- Generated Content

- Businesses like Facebook, reddit and Twitter.
- Primary concern is the growth of an engaged community that creates content.
- In this model, one is focused on the creation of good content: not only posts but also votes, comments, spam flagging etc.
- Engagement funnel: trying to move your population to higher and higher levels of engagement, turning lurkers into voters, voters into commenters, etc.
- UGC company cares about metrics as:

1) Number of engaged visitors
- How often people come back, and how long they stick around.
- Common metrics: day-to-week ratio and days since last visit.

2) Content creation
- Percentage of visitors that interact with content in some way.
- User participation varies wildly by UGC site and depending on what you're asking users to do.

3) Engagement funnel changes
- How well the site moves people to more engaged levels of content over time.
- The key is to move as many users into the more lucrative tier of engagement as possible.
- One trick to visualize how users are moving on the tiers is comparing tiers of engagement over time: for a given cohort of users, how long does it take them to move to a more valuable state in the funnel?

4)  Value of created content
- The business benefit of content, from donation to media clicks.
- If you're trying to decide where to invest in visitor acquisition, you'll want to know which referring sites bring valuable users.

5) Content sharing and virality
- How content gets shared, and how it drives growth.
- You want to track how content is shared for several reasons:
    - You need to know if you're achieving a level of virality that will sustain your business.
    - You want to understand how content is shared and with whom.
    - It will help you understand whether you should consider a paywall-style monetization strategy.

6) Notification effectiveness
- The percentage of users who act on when receiving a notification.

- The UGC business might focus on user contribution above all else, but it still pays its bills with advertising most of the time.

### Chapter 13 - Model Six: Two-Sided Marketplaces

- In this model, the company makes money when a buyer and a seller come together to complete a transaction.
- Ebay is the most famous example of this business.
- Other business models consist of: real state listing buyers and sellers of properties; websites that let artists list projects and collect the support of backers; app stores let software developers list their apps; dating sites allow and inventory of prospective partners to browse one another.
- In the definition of this book, on a marketplace:
    - The seller is responsible for listing and promoting the product.
    - The marketplace owner has a "hands off" approach to the individual transactions.
    - The buyer and the seller have competing interests.
- Two-sided marketplaces face a unique problem: they have to attract **both** buyers and sellers.
- Early on, the big challenge is solving the "chicken and egg"problem of finding enough buyers and sellers.
- Companies boil down to one thing: *focus on whomever has the money*. Usually, it's the buyers.
- In the beginning, when you don't have a "third-party" inventory (aka sellers), you can create an artificial inventory and sell it yourself until you have enough sellers in your environment.
    - For example, when Uber started, they bought available towncars and paid drivers USD 30 per hour to drive passengers around, and switched to a commission model once it had enough demand.
- If you focus on the buyer side, you can *create demand*, meaning you can pick something for which you can command an initial inventory, then purchase some, or you might take orders with a promise of fulfilling them later.
- The first step of a two-sided marketplace, and the first thing to measure, is your *ability to create an inventory* (supply) or *an audience* (demand).
- The common metrics are:
    - Buyer and seller growth (measured by returning visitors over time).
    - Inventory growth (the rate at which sellers are adding inventory).
    - Search effectiveness (what buyers are searching for, and whether it matches the inventory).
    - Conversion funnels (conversion rates for items sold, and any segmentation that reveals what helps sell items).
        - The funnel will have several stages, starting with the number of searches done by visitors.
        - You should also measure the number of *satisfied* transactions.
    - Ratings and signs of fraud.
    - Pricing metrics, if you have a bidding method in place.
- Fraud and trust are big issues for marketplaces. You don't want to assume responsibility for the delivery of goods, but you need to ensure that there are reliable reputation systems.
- One more major issue is keeping the transaction within the network, meaning to avoid buyers and sellers to find one another through your marketplace, and then concluding their business without getting a transaction fee.
