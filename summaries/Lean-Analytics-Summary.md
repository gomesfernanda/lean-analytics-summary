## Chapter 1: We're all liars
- Sometimes, growth comes from an aspect of your business you don't expect. When you think you've found a worthwhile idea, decide how to test it quickly, with minimal investment. Define what success looks like beforehand, and know what you're going to do if your hunch is right.
Lean, analytical thinking is about asking the right questions, and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you're after.

## Chapter 2: How to Keep Score
- What makes a good metric?
	- a good metric is comparative.
	- a good metric is understandable.
	- a good metric is a ratio or a rate (ratio is easier to act on, are inherently comparative and also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there's an inherent tension).
	- a good metric changes the way you behave.
- Accounting metrics: like sales revenue and such, shows how close you are to your business model.
- Experimental metrics: like the results of a test , help you optimize the product/pricing/market. Change in these metrics will change your behavior.
- If you want to change behavior, your metric must be tied to the behavioral change you want. If you measure something and it's not attached to a goal, you're wasting your time.
- Metrics often come in pairs.
- KPIs (key performance indicators): specific metrics that drive the business.
- Qualitative vs Quantitative Metrics
	- To get a business started, you need qualitative input because you're exploring.
	- Quantitative data abhors emotion; qualitative data marinates in it.
	- Collecting good qualitative data takes preparation so you don't get misleading results.
- Vanity Vs Real Metrics
	- If you have a piece of data that you can't act on, it's vanity metric.
	- Key question: "what will I do differently based on this information?"
	- Vanity metrics: number of hits, page views, visits, unique visitors, followers/friends/likes, time on site/number of pages, emails collected, downloads.
- Exploratory Vs Reporting Metrics
	- Reporting: the "known unknowns"; we know we don't know the value of the metric, so we go find out.
	- Exploratory: the "unknown unknowns"; leads to discoveries that can disrupt the market.
- Leading Vs Lagging Metrics
	- Leading: tries to predict the future.
	- Lagging: gives you an indication that there's a problem.
	- For leading indicators to work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.
	- Lagging and leading metrics can both be actionable, but leading indicators show you what _will_ happen, reducing your cycle time and making you leaner.
- Correlated Vs Causal Metrics
	- Correlations can help you predict what will happen, but finding the _cause_ of something means you can change it.
	- You prove causality by finding a correlation, then running an experiment in which you control the other variables and measure the difference (however, this is a very hard thing to do in practice).
	- Correlation is good. Causality is great.
- Moving targets:
	- In the beginning of your business, your metrics and goals will be a little blurred, and this shall be adjusted as time passes and you have a clearer idea on the ones that are more meaningful.
	- It's reasonable to update your metrics accordingly.
	- Make early assumptions and set targets for what you think success looks like, but don't experiment yourself into oblivion. Lower the bar if necessary, but not for the sake of getting over it.
	- Use qualitative data to understand what value you're creating and adjust only if the new 'line in the sand' reflects how customers are using your product.
