## PART 1: Stop lying to yourself

### Chapter 1: We're all liars
- Sometimes, growth comes from an aspect of your business you don't expect. When you think you've found a worthwhile idea, decide how to test it quickly, with minimal investment. Define what success looks like beforehand, and know what you're going to do if your hunch is right.
Lean, analytical thinking is about asking the right questions, and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you're after.

### Chapter 2: How to Keep Score
- What makes a good metric?
	- a good metric is comparative.
	- a good metric is understandable.
	- a good metric is a ratio or a rate (ratio is easier to act on, are inherently comparative and also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there's an inherent tension).
	- a good metric changes the way you behave.
- Accounting metrics: like sales revenue and such, shows how close you are to your business model.
- Experimental metrics: like the results of a test , help you optimize the product/pricing/market. Change in these metrics will change your behavior.
- If you want to change behavior, your metric must be tied to the behavioral change you want. If you measure something and it's not attached to a goal, you're wasting your time.
- Metrics often come in pairs.
- KPIs (key performance indicators): specific metrics that drive the business.
- Qualitative vs Quantitative Metrics
	- To get a business started, you need qualitative input because you're exploring.
	- Quantitative data abhors emotion; qualitative data marinates in it.
	- Collecting good qualitative data takes preparation so you don't get misleading results.
- Vanity Vs Real Metrics
	- If you have a piece of data that you can't act on, it's vanity metric.
	- Key question: "what will I do differently based on this information?"
	- Vanity metrics: number of hits, page views, visits, unique visitors, followers/friends/likes, time on site/number of pages, emails collected, downloads.
- Exploratory Vs Reporting Metrics
	- Reporting: the "known unknowns"; we know we don't know the value of the metric, so we go find out.
	- Exploratory: the "unknown unknowns"; leads to discoveries that can disrupt the market.
- Leading Vs Lagging Metrics
	- Leading: tries to predict the future.
	- Lagging: gives you an indication that there's a problem.
	- For leading indicators to work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.
	- Lagging and leading metrics can both be actionable, but leading indicators show you what _will_ happen, reducing your cycle time and making you leaner.
- Correlated Vs Causal Metrics
	- Correlations can help you predict what will happen, but finding the _cause_ of something means you can change it.
	- You prove causality by finding a correlation, then running an experiment in which you control the other variables and measure the difference (however, this is a very hard thing to do in practice).
	- Correlation is good. Causality is great.
- Moving targets:
	- In the beginning of your business, your metrics and goals will be a little blurred, and this shall be adjusted as time passes and you have a clearer idea on the ones that are more meaningful.
	- It's reasonable to update your metrics accordingly.
	- Make early assumptions and set targets for what you think success looks like, but don't experiment yourself into oblivion. Lower the bar if necessary, but not for the sake of getting over it.
	- Use qualitative data to understand what value you're creating and adjust only if the new 'line in the sand' reflects how customers are using your product.
- Testing creates a kind of scientific comparison that may be useful to justify a change
- Segmentation
	- Segment: a group that shares some common characteristic.
- Cohort analysis
	- Compares similar groups over time.
	- One compares cohorts against one another to see if, on the whole, key metrics are getting better over time.
- A/B and Multivariate testing
	- Cross-sectional studies: studies in which different groups of test subjects are given different experiences at the same time.
	- Problem with A/B testing: you'll have more things to test than you'll have traffic.

	- Multivariate analysis: analyze a series of tests done at the same time, relying on statistical analysis of the results to see which of many factors correlates strongly with an improvement in traffic.
- Much of Lean Analytics is about finding a meaningful metric, then running experiments to improve it until that metric is good enough for you to move to the next problem or next stage of your business.

### Chapter 3: Deciding What to Do With Your Life
- Lean Canvas: nine boxes organized on a sheet of paper, designed to walk through the most important aspects of business.
	- Problem (& existing alternatives)
	- Solution
	- Key metrics
	- Unique value proposition (& high-level concept)
	- Unfair advantage
	- Channels
	- Customer segments (& early adopters)
	- Cost Structure
	- Revenue streams
- Don't start a business you’re going to hate.
- When launching a new venture, you need to properly assess:
	- If you want to do it.
	- If you're good doing it.
	- If you can make money doing it.
- If you want to do something and are good at it, but can’t be paid to do it, _learn to monetize_.- If you’re good at something and can be paid to do it, but don’t like doing it, _learn to say no_.- If you like to do something and can be paid to do it, but aren’t very good at it, _learn to do it well_.
- Never start a company on a level playing field— that’s where everyone else is standing.

### Chapter 4: Data-Driven Versus Data-Informed
- Data-driven machine optimization, when not moderated by human judgement, can cause problems.
	- Humans do inspiration, machines do validation.
	- Optimization is all about finding the lowest or highest values of a particular function. A machine can find an optimal setting, but it will be a *local* optimal.
	- Humans, on the other hand, can find other "functions".
	- Math is good at optimizing a known system; humans are good at finding a new one.
- Machine-only optimization suffers from limitations. If you're optimizing for local maxima, you might be missing a bigger, more important opportunity.
- Companies can get *too* data-driven. Instead, they could be more data-informed.
- How to think like a data scientist: avoid common pitfalls like...
	- Assuming the data is clean.
	- Not normalizing.
	- Excluding outliers.
	- Including outliers.
	- Ignoring seasonality.
	- Ignoring size when reporting growth.
	- Data vomit.
	- Metrics that cry wolf.
	- The "Not Collected Here" syndrome.
	- Focusing on noise.
- Entrepreneurs should find the perfect combination between big vision and data.
- You need to think of Lean Startup as the process you use to mode toward and achieve your vision.

## PART 2: Finding the right metric for right now

### Chapter 5: Analytics Frameworks
- There are a set of frameworks, and each one offers a different perspective on a startup lifecycle.
- Some frameworks are:
- *Dave McClure's Pirate Metrics*
	- metrics that a startup needs fit inside the categories: AARRA = acquisition, activation, retention, revenue and referral.
	- acquisition: how do users become aware of you? traffic, mentions, CPC, search results, cost acquisition, open rate.
	- activation: do drive-by visitors subscribe and use? enrollments, signups, completed on boarding process, used the service at least once, subscriptions.
	- retention: does a one-time user become engaged? engagement, time since last visit, daily and monthly active use, churns.
	- revenue: do you make money from user activity? customer lifetime value, conversion rate, shopping cart size, click-through revenue.
	- referral: do users promote your product? invites sent, viral coefficient, viral cycle time.
- *Eric Ries's Engines of Growth*
	- 3 engines that drive the growth of a startup, each one with KPIs.
	- 1. Sticky Engine: focus of getting users to return. Engagement is key here. Fundamental KPI is user retention.
	- 2. Virality Engine: is all about getting the word out. Key metric is _viral coefficient_ |(number of new users that bring new ones on).
	- 3. Paid Engine: payment. Important KPIs: customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC).
- *Ash Maurya's Lean Canvas*
	- Box: "Problem" // Metrics: respondents who have this need, respondents who are aware of having the need.
	- Box: "Solution" // Metrics: respondents who try the MVP, engagement, churn, most/last used features, people willing to pay.
	- Box: "Unique value proposition" // Metrics: feedback scores, independent ratings, sentiment analysis, customer-worded descriptions, surveys, search, competitive analysis.
	- Box: "Customer segments" // Metrics: how easy it is to find groups of prospects, unique key-work segments, targeted funnel traffic from a particular source.
	- Box: "Channels" // Metrics: leads and customers per channel, viral coefficient and cycle, net promoter score, open rate, affiliate margins, click-through rate, PageRank, message search.
	- Box: "Unfair advantage" // Metrics: respondents' understanding of the UVP (unique value proposition), patents, brand equity, barriers to entry, number of new entrants, exclusivity of relationships.
	- Box: "Revenue streams" // Metrics: lifetime customer value, average revenue per user, conversion rate, shopping cart size, click-through rate.
	- Box: "Cost structure" // Metrics: fixed costs, cost of customer acquisition, cost of servicing the nth customer, support costs, keyword costs.
- *Sean Elli's Startup Growth Pyramid*
	- ![SeanElli](http://i64.tinypic.com/2ho90zo.png)
	- This pyramid is focused on _after_ you achieve market fit.
	- How to know you've achieved market fit: survey with customer asking how they would feel if they could no longer use the product/service. If 40% or more say they'd be disappointed, you're market fit and it's time to scale.
- *The Long Funnel*
	- A way of understanding how you first come to someone's attention, and the journey she takes from that initial awareness through a goal you want her to complete.

	- 5 stages: Empathy, Stickiness, Virality, Revenue and Scale.
